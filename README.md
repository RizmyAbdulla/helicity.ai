# Helicity.ai Game Engine Open Source Project :rocket:

Hello and welcome, dear Open Source contributor! :blush: :wave:

I'm thrilled to have you here. My name is Abhishek and I'm the sole creator of the Helicity.ai project, an intuitive, and fun game engine that I've poured countless hours into building.

#Documentation
Please access the detailed docs here. https://helicity.gitbook.io/docs/

## About this Repository :books:

In this repository, you'll find the open source part of Helicity.ai's game engine. You can copy all the code from the helicity.ai code editor and paste it into the `Main.js` file here.

## What's Coming Up :crystal_ball:

The exciting news is that a multiplayer framework is currently being developed! The `RNetworking.js` file will soon be equipped with the ability to create multiplayer games with ease. Stay tuned for more updates on this!

Similarly I'm coming up with a Sound.js to handle sound and in parallel building the other modules.

## Supporting Helicity.ai :heart:

While this repository contains the open source part of Helicity.ai, there's so much more on the main site. I mean AI?! Helicity.ai is not just about codeâ€”it's about community. I would greatly appreciate it if you'd consider supporting the project by using our main site, which is packed with additional features like direct hosting.

## Join Our Community :earth_americas:

I encourage you to join our growing community! We have a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RkH98RgVDr) where we discuss all things related to game development, share our projects, and help each other grow as developers. I'm also available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilshake/) for any professional inquiries or discussions.

## Final Words :mega:

Remember, open source is about more than code. It's about the people. Every line of code you contribute, every bug you report, and even every time you use Helicity.ai supports this project and helps me continue to maintain and improve it.

Happy coding, and may the power of open source be with you! :dizzy:

Cheers,  
Abhishek and the Helicity.ai project :rocket:
